# My Entry to the Spellbook Associate challenge

tldr: edit docx using openai / anthropic / whatever llm provider you want tool calls to edit docx specific in the your mission file

Somehow this got me the opportunity to work on the actual spellbook associate even though this half works and I threw this together in a semester I was way to busy to have any right to work on this

IF you are going to attempt this challenge implement RAG I didn't use RAG I should've used RAG trust me use RAG your life will be better after the initial hurdle

ALSO claude is literally insanely good at this stuff I was out of my mind for using 4o for this kinda surprised it managed this at all

## To Run This Code:

- poetry must be installed
- poetry dotenv plugin must be installed ```poetry self add poetry-dotenv-plugin```
- a .env file must be created with the var OPENAI_API_KEY set to a valid openai api key
- running this code will use a lot of tokens do so at your own risk
